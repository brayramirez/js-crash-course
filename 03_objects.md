# 03: Objects

Object is a collection of properties, wherein each property is composed of a key-value pair.

```js
var myObject = {"key1": "value01", "key2": "value02"};
```

Keys are automatically converted to strings, so you can just create keys like this:

```js
var myObject = {key1: "value01", key2: "value02"};
```
